# SynergyForge: The Longevity Combination Engine & Organoid Simulator

**Live Demo:** [https://neuroidss.github.io/Combination-Synergy-Engine/](https://neuroidss.github.io/Combination-Synergy-Engine/)

This project is a browser-first platform for an **AI agent capable of autonomous bioinformatics research**, which powers an educational organoid simulation game.

The application is built on a modular architecture where an agent can build its own tools to achieve its goals. The core of the system is a scientific validation engine that ensures all data is derived from reliable, primary sources.

## Key Features

*   **Scientific Validation Engine:** An AI-powered pipeline that searches scientific databases (PubMed, Patents, Preprints), validates primary sources, scores their reliability, and provides concise summaries. This forms the "guarantee of scientificity" for all subsequent analysis.
*   **Synergy Analysis:** The agent analyzes validated literature to identify synergistic, additive, or antagonistic interactions between longevity interventions.
*   **Self-Improving Agent:** The agent can create new tools (`Tool Creator`) and workflows, allowing it to learn and become more effective at research over time.
*   **"Organoid Odyssey" Simulator:** An engaging simulation game where users can apply the discovered therapeutic combinations to a virtual neural organoid and observe the effects on its health and lifespan. This turns complex scientific data into an interactive, educational experience.
*   **Client-First / Serverless by Default:** The entire AI research and simulation UI runs in the browser without any required backend. Simply open `index.html` to get started. An optional Node.js backend can be run to unlock more advanced capabilities.

## Getting Started

Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome or Edge). No installation or server is required to run the core application.

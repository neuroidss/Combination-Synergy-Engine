# SynergyForge: A Discovery Engine for Longevity & Neuro-Enhancement

**Live Demo:** [https://neuroidss.github.io/Combination-Synergy-Engine/](https://neuroidss.github.io/Combination-Synergy-Engine/)

SynergyForge is a browser-first platform for an **AI agent capable of autonomous bioinformatics research**. It mines thousands of scientific papers to discover novel, synergistic interventions for longevity and powers an educational organoid simulation game to visualize their effects.

The core of the platform is a discovery engine that goes beyond simple search. It maps the entire landscape of scientific knowledge, identifies unexplored gaps between research areas, and generates novel, testable hypotheses to fill them.

## The Discovery Engine: Finding What's Next

Inspired by AI techniques used to find "patent vacancies," SynergyForge applies the same principle to the vast world of scientific literature.

1.  **Live Discovery Map:** The agent ingests thousands of scientific papers and uses text embeddings to generate a 2D "Discovery Map." On this map, the distance between any two points represents their conceptual similarity. This creates a visual representation of the entire research landscape.

2.  **Identifying Semantic Vacancies:** The engine then identifies "vacancies"—unexplored gaps that lie between related but distinct clusters of research. A vacancy represents a profound opportunity: a non-obvious connection that no one has made yet.

3.  **Hypothesis Generation (`InterpretVacancy`):** When a user clicks a vacancy, the AI analyzes the neighboring research papers and performs "embedding inversion." It generates a detailed, hypothetical abstract for a new scientific paper that would perfectly fill that conceptual gap. This translates an abstract opportunity into a concrete, novel, and often revolutionary research idea.

### Use Case 1: Discovering Neuronal Anti-aging Therapies

To find new ways to reverse brain aging, the engine is given the objective: *"Discover synergistic interventions to reverse neuronal aging by enhancing mitochondrial function, promoting neurogenesis, and reducing neuroinflammation."*

*   **Result:** The engine builds a map of neurobiology and aging research.
*   **Hypothesis:** It identifies a vacancy between research on **"mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's"** and **"autophagy in clearing synaptic proteins."**
*   **Generated Idea:** The AI proposes a novel combination therapy: a small molecule that enhances **mitophagy** (clearing damaged mitochondria) paired with a peptide that **promotes synaptic protein synthesis**. The synergy lies in simultaneously removing dysfunctional energy sources at the synapse while rebuilding it—a new, trial-ready concept.

### Use Case 2: Engineering "Superneurons"

To explore cognitive enhancement, the objective is set to: *"Identify interventions to enhance cognitive function, memory, and network efficiency beyond the physiological baseline."*

*   **Result:** The engine maps the landscape of nootropics, genetic engineering, and neuro-stimulation.
*   **Hypothesis:** It finds a vacancy between **"CRISPR-based epigenetic editing for memory"** and **"optogenetics for precise neuronal activation."**
*   **Generated Idea:** The AI generates an abstract for a groundbreaking technology: an AAV gene therapy delivering a **light-sensitive CRISPR-Cas9 system**. This system could be non-invasively controlled by transcranial light to dynamically rewrite the epigenetic marks on genes related to learning and memory, enabling "programmable plasticity" and an unprecedented rate of learning.

## Key Features

*   **Live Discovery Map & Hypothesis Generation:** Visualizes the scientific landscape and uses AI to generate novel research ideas from the gaps.
*   **Scientific Validation Engine:** An AI pipeline that searches PubMed, patents, and preprints, validates primary sources, scores their reliability, and provides concise summaries.
*   **Synergy Analysis Engine:** Analyzes validated literature to identify and score synergistic, additive, or antagonistic interactions between interventions (drugs, devices, and behaviors).
*   **"Organoid Odyssey" Simulator:** An engaging simulation where users apply discovered combinations to virtual neural organoids and observe the effects on health and lifespan across four major theories of aging.
*   **Self-Improving Agent:** The agent can create new tools and workflows, allowing it to learn and become more effective at research over time.
*   **Client-First / Serverless:** The entire AI research and simulation UI runs in the browser without any required backend. Simply open `index.html` to get started.

## Getting Started

Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome or Edge). No installation or server is required to run the core application.

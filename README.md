# SynergyForge: A Discovery Engine for Longevity & Neuro-Enhancement

**Live Demo:** [https://neuroidss.github.io/Combination-Synergy-Engine/](https://neuroidss.github.io/Combination-Synergy-Engine/)

SynergyForge is a browser-first platform for an **AI agent capable of autonomous bioinformatics research**. It mines thousands of scientific papers to discover novel, synergistic interventions for longevity and powers an educational organoid simulation game to visualize their effects.

The core of the platform is a discovery engine that goes beyond simple search. It builds a real-time, financially-oriented **Intervention Knowledge Space** to identify unexplored connections between research areas and generate novel, testable, and cost-analyzed investment opportunities.

## The Discovery Engine: Finding What's Next

Instead of mapping papers, SynergyForge builds a dynamic knowledge graph where the nodes are interventions (e.g., Metformin, Exercise) and the edges are synergies. This creates a living, financially-oriented model of the scientific landscape that directly answers the question, "Where should we invest next?"

1.  **Real-time Intervention Knowledge Space:** As the agent reads scientific literature, it populates a "knowledge space" in real-time. Each new intervention discovered becomes a node in this space.

2.  **Instant Costing & Synergy Identification:** For each intervention, the agent immediately estimates its in-vitro validation cost. It then identifies **known synergies** described in the literature, creating connections between intervention nodes. Each connection is immediately scored for scientific promise and its total cost is calculated.

3.  **On-the-Fly Hypothesis Generation:** This is the core of the discovery engine. After analyzing an article and identifying the interventions it discusses (e.g., A, B, and C) and the synergies it proves (e.g., A+B), the AI immediately looks for "knowledge gaps." It asks: "What about A+C, or B+C?" It then generates these **hypothetical synergies**, scores them, costs them, and adds them to the knowledge space as new, high-potential investment opportunities.

### Use Case 1: Discovering Neuronal Anti-aging Therapies

To find new ways to reverse brain aging, the engine is given the objective: *"Discover synergistic interventions to reverse neuronal aging by enhancing mitochondrial function, promoting neurogenesis, and reducing neuroinflammation."*

*   **Result:** The engine analyzes a meta-review on neuronal aging, identifying interventions like **"Urolithin A"** (enhances mitophagy), **"Lion's Mane"** (promotes neurogenesis), and **"transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)"** (reduces neuroinflammation).
*   **Known Synergy:** It extracts a known synergy between Urolithin A and Lion's Mane, immediately costing and scoring it.
*   **Generated Hypothesis:** The AI notes that no combination with TMS is mentioned. It generates a novel, tri-modal hypothesis: combining Urolithin A and Lion's Mane with a targeted TMS protocol to create a powerful, multi-pronged approach to clear damaged components, rebuild neurons, and create a healthier environment for them to thrive in. This new, cost-analyzed proposal appears instantly in the investment opportunities feed.

### Use Case 2: Engineering "Superneurons"

To explore cognitive enhancement, the objective is set to: *"Identify interventions to enhance cognitive function, memory, and network efficiency beyond the physiological baseline."*

*   **Result:** The engine processes an article discussing **"ampakines"** (a class of cognitive enhancers) and **"meditation"** (a behavioral intervention).
*   **Hypothesis Generation:** It immediately generates a hypothetical synergy, proposing that a low dose of an ampakine could amplify the plastic changes in the brain induced by focused-attention meditation, leading to a synergistic improvement in learning rates. This novel "pharma-behavioral" combination is costed, scored, and presented as a new opportunity.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Intervention Knowledge Space:** Identifies interventions from literature, costs them, and maps both known and hypothetical synergies between them.
*   **Scientific Validation Engine:** An AI pipeline that searches PubMed, patents, and preprints, validates primary sources, scores their reliability, and provides concise summaries.
*   **Synergy Analysis Engine:** Analyzes validated literature to identify and score synergistic, additive, or antagonistic interactions between interventions (drugs, devices, and behaviors).
*   **"Organoid Odyssey" Simulator:** An engaging simulation where users apply discovered combinations to virtual neural organoids and observe the effects on health and lifespan across four major theories of aging.
*   **Self-Improving Agent:** The agent can create new tools and workflows, allowing it to learn and become more effective at research over time.
*   **Client-First / Serverless:** The entire AI research and simulation UI runs in the browser without any required backend. Simply open `index.html` to get started.

## Getting Started

Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome or Edge). No installation or server is required to run the core application.
